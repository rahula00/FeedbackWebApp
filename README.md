## Commands
These are just some helpful commands you might want to use when branching
### `git checkout branchName`
Switch to a branch by this name that is locally stored

### `git pull origin/branchName`
### `git checkout branchName`
This pulls a branch from the repo, then you switch to it locally

### `git branch -D branchName`
This deletes a branch

### `git status`
This displays if the branch you're in is up to date

## Checking code in on console
1. `cd ..` to root directory... i.e. leasr
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "MESSAGE DESCRIBING WHAT YOU DID"`
4. `git push`... sometimes you may need to copy the upstream command because it hasn't been created yet, just copy and paste the prompted one in console
